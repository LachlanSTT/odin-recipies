            <li>Place yeast,sugar and water into mixing bowl and warm 2min/37°C/speed 1.</li>
            <li>Add yoghurt and flour and mix 3sec/speed 3.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil, salt and baking powder and knead dough/30 sec.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough into an oiled ceramic or glass bowl and place a kitchen towel
                over the top. Leave dough to prove in a warm place until doubled in size(approx. 2hours).
            </li>
            <li>Transfer dough onto a silicone bread mat or floured work surface.Clean and dry
                ceramic or glass bowl, dust with extra flour and set aside. Separate dough into 10 equal-sized pieces(the
                dough will be extremely sticky). Lightly work each piece into a ball and placeinto prepared ceramic or glass 
                bowl, ensuring the naan don't stick to each other.
            </li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into an oval, then shape the naan by strectching it out to
                create a longer oval(approx. 30 x 10 cm). Lightly flour each naan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place butter and granulated garlic(optional) into mixing bowl and melt 1-2min/50°C/speed 1, or until buter has melted.</li>
            <li>Place a large frying pan over high heat. Working one naan at a time, place into frying pan and cook until dark brown
                blisters start to form (approx 1-1½ minutes each side). Remove naan from the heat, brush with melted butter 
                and garlic mixture, then sprinkle with a little salt. Serve hot alongside your favorite curry.
